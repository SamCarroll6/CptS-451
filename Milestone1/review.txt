I Iove what they have done to improve the building and add outdoor dining. Service is always good here and on par with other top places in Mentor. I really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy! Everything I've had on the menu has been great.	0	0	0

Service was friendly and fast, food was excellent, and they have DRAFT BEER, including a couple of Mexican brews.

This location is the best Don Tequila I have been to.	0	0	0

We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.	0	0	0

Food is definately "americanized" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect.... But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce.... So if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food....

They scratch your order on a piece of paper with no descriptions and prices never add up. Its ALWAYS more. We have checked this several tines and wrote down everything we ordered and the prices on the menu and its been 20-30% higher consistently every time.  Its too bad they scam their customers like this because the food really is awesome.  Write down everything you order and be prepared to question your bill.	0	0	0

I had the Chori pollo, which is a burrito with chorizo and chicken with rice.  Man, it was amazing. Hot and spicy with peppers, I took some of the huge portion home and ate it the next day.  

The service was seriously, amazingly fast for a group of 4, and they kept our drinks regularly filled.	1	0	0

We were greeted promptly and brought to our table.  The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was a little blander than we care for.  Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening.  I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautéed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was average.  My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito.  Hubby said it was above average.  The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro.  We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest.  Overall, we rated it as adequate to good.	0	0	0

We end up getting charged at least a few dollars more than our menu items should be when we check out, and it's happened on several different occasions. 

Though the food may have been good and reasonably priced (on the menu, not on the bill), we will unfortunately never be going back. Very disappointing.	1	0	0

It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piña colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this  and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included. Not as bad as others but not great by any means.	1	0	0

We both ordered off the specials menu, and my husband barely managed to squeeze in his standard 'where's my burrito' before two large plates, overflowing with food, arrived in front of us.

The food itself was good. Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow.

Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25.  Definitely planning another visit.	3	0	2

I went with a friend of mine from the area, who was treated like a rock star when he arrived (well, he IS a rock star), and that's indicative of the casual and familial vibe at this restaurant.  I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious.  Margaritas were excellent (this much I do remember) and service was quick and pleasant.  Now that I know that this place exists, it gives me even more reason to travel to the northern tip of Ohio for good company and eats!	0	0	2	
z6wG7RrcONWJlxE8AJypeg	YBbNemmB8wWbKGr6V3bCAA	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	1	2015-06-05	This will probably be my last review of this location. I was at don tequila yesterday & the cashier was talking  to me but I couldn't understand so I laughed it off. 
    
He told me I looked sexy today and said something else. I said thanks and laughed so that he wouldn't be offended. He came around the counter and walked up on me then hugged me so I assume he was asking for a hug. 
    
He then whispered in my ear that he just wanted to feel my breast on his chest. Seriously....I don't feel like I need to wear jeans and sweaters in the summer because he is a pervert. 

It was very disrespectful and unprofessional and I feel uncomfortable eating there anymore.	1	2	0

The roomy booths offer space for cozy dinner or enough room for your whole brood or gang of friends. Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice.

I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce.

Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!! 

The staff is friendly and patiently gives you time to check-out the menu and answer any questions. nom.nom.	0	0	0	
wPGXLAQX0z7FVh1PhInyLg	MGBv4e-Z6lfyUcSVwPXQPA	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	4	2012-11-26	i love this place!

First impressions this place is a fun atmosphere filled with mexican clay rooftops and colorful furniture.  You get your chips and salsa as you sit down as usual while they take orders for drinks.  They got horchata here now, which is a + in my book, if you haven't tried it yet, i totally recommend to.  

The food came out rather fast and speedy on extremely hot plates.  The salsa and hot sauces there are bombbbbb. Ask them for homemade style hot sauces they make in the kitchen, it's different everytime you go in.  Some will leave you sweating and some will leave a sweet or an extra tomato flavor in your mouth.

The food i'd definitely rate 7.5/10. as i'm a hardcore mexican food lover.  It's nothing you find in texas or california, but quite damn close.  I always find myself coming back to this fun filled, warm, family owned place and always leave feeling satisfied.  for taqueria style tacos, try the tacos el pastor!	0	0	1

Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered. Boyfriend got a combo platter with an enchilada and taquito and devoured the whole thing. I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good! 

The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros.	1	0	1

It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back.	0	0	0

Our server was professional, and bilingual.  But you could totally understand him and had a cool accent.  Americanized i suppose.  They do not use a POS system but use an old paper check system...so separate checks becomes an issue.

They put tons of chips and salsa in front of you...the chips are super crunch but almost no salt, and the salsa was bland for my taste.

I had the el paso speciai; beef tip burrito and chicken burrito w/ rice and beans.  All came out hot but a little watery.  Dunno where that came from.  But I did ask for lettuce/tomato set as it did not come with any in or on it.

Kids food came out fast, they did have the world cup and that seemed to distract the waiters...but as far as Mexican food goes it was pretty good for Mentor.	0	0	0

Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon.	4	1	2

      First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much. 
    As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.	2	0	1

I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.

I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty.	3	0	3

Gotta try this humble and family operated place. Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican food

The cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too. 

When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!	4	1	2

This place ROCKS! Totally authentic mexican food. The tacos and flautas are legit and hit the spot dead on. We are mexican and we know our cuisine and you can't go wrong eating here. Just stop reading this review and try it. Like now.  Go!	1	0	1

Everything was fresh right down to the rice. A nice older couple seem to run the restaurant. The prices are fair, it's probably not not in the best part of N. Vegas but worth trying out, we'll be back.	0	0	0

The owners are so sweet and kind. Their food is absolutely delicious. I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL. 
YOU WONT FIND MANY CLOSE TO HOME, DOWN TO EARTH AND DELICIOUS PLACES LIKE THIS.	1	0	0

EEAdWv92XwDgFnJOmacXHA	u5o_QDwRPQW8gjgFudu9bg	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2016-12-01	Came here while visiting my friend in Vegas.  We wanted tacos and I'm picky about Mexican food.  This place totally hit the mark.  Not only was it delicious, the lady taking orders was super sweet and a really good salesperson.  I was debating on getting carne asada fries because i had already had fast food that day.  Here's how the convo went:

Her: do you eat them [carne asada fries] every day?  
Me: well, no...
Her: then they're not so bad then
Me: good point

Salsa bar was on point and the spicy carrots and onions were crispy and super hot.  Yum.	2	2	2

The hospitality is incredible. This is NOT your typical Mexican turn-and-burn kind of place. Every dish I've ordered thus far has been absolutely fantastic...Well assembled and delicious. Personally, I love the "caldo de pollo" (chicken soup). I could eat it every day! This establishment is a definite winner in my book!!	1	0	0

Having been raised in San Antonio, I feel like I know great Mexican food. And we found it here. The food is very authentic because they know how to build the meal with a great foundation. The chips and homemade tortillas are to die for. We all had various tacos, chicken and asada. Their burritos are huge!  The best part of the meal was the carnitas nachos. Don't miss out on them. When I'm back in vegas again, a meal here will be on my itinerary.	2	0	1

But I do have a problem with the massive lines and the seating. I assume that this is the way In and out burger is but I do not like to wait for a burger then have to scan the room for a dirty table that I have to wipe down myself.	0	0	0	
hN47f6bhfsfrenzgMp89hQ	1KmCv57hyxZdtd_COuTZgA	qU4wrOVqDfddr9PP_ssmUA	5	2015-02-11	Showed up here at 12:57 AM a few nights ago -- we were driving from Tucson to Los Angeles, and pulled off on a whim, hoping this location had hours to 1:30 or 2 AM.  The place looked open, but empty -- we pulled into the drive through, asked if they were still open, and received a very enthusiastic "For three more minutes!"  

I felt bad about it, but the cashier was nice, and the fellow who handed us our burgers jokingly said that they were made with love.  It seems odd to say it, but he sounded genuinely sincere.  

Ordered two cheeseburgers with extra everything, a double-double, and two fries.  Fries were piping hot / crispy, single burgers were heavily laden with at least 2.5 times the normal veggies -- unusually large for 'extra everything.'  

I wouldn't normally leave a review for an In N Out, but everyone we spoke to was very nice, and they served us so close to closing.  Thank you!	2	0	0	
HHDTZDe054Lrp43TZqgocQ	q9na5vXKRKJDjwWa-oR_bQ	qU4wrOVqDfddr9PP_ssmUA	3	2013-06-03	It had been a while since I had been to an In N Out, and I figured I would give it another chance.  I've lived in California twice, and everyone there is obsessed with the place.  I can remember my first time visiting and thinking, meh, it's just ok.  So, I walked in to the Dysart location and stood in line for fifteen minutes and then waited ten more minutes for my food.  My opinion: meh.  Their fries are good, but their burger is nothing special.  Five Guys and Whataburger beat it hands down, every day of the week.  So next time I was hungry, that's exactly what I did....go across I10 and get something that I enjoy.	1	0	1

I like their fresh cut deli meats, but my favorite is always the TUNA, which is never soggy with mayo.  They do limit their toppings, but with great meat and bread all those toppings the competitors offer are not required.  

They're always friendly and quick and the owner/manager is always there making sandwiches too.

Why buy a $10 sandwich at WholeFoods when you can get a better one at Blimpie's?	3	1	2
